## Biological model

![Memristive spinal cord biological model](../images/spinal-cord-diagram/spinal-cord-diagram.png)

This is original biological model based on works of Igor Lavrov and it was proposed based on biological experiments (add references here), 

## Electronic model 


## 1 muscle validation experiment 

### Preparation

1. Experimentator puts shoes with insole controller on corresponding foot.
1. Insole controller connected to the CPG implementation device.
1. CPG device is connected to stimulator via DAC.
1. Stimulator is attached to the muscle nerve.

### Protocol
Healthy volunteer sitting or with BWS system.

1. Relax the examined foot.
1. Balance the weight over the relaxed foot - heel.
1. Record the reaction of the examined muscle as electrical activity the angle and the feeling of extension/contraction of the muscle.
1. Balance the weight over the examined foot towards toe in 3-5 steps.
1. Record the reaction of the examined muscle as electrical activity the angle and the feeling of extension/contraction of the muscle.
